\subsection{Week 15}
\par \citet{2012MNRAS.420..672S} : {From star-forming spirals to passive spheroids: integral field spectroscopy of E+A galaxies} : Abstract: We present three-dimensional spectroscopy of 11 E+A galaxies at z= 0.06-0.12. These galaxies were selected for their strong H$\delta$ [JP: 4102 $\AA$] absorption but weak (or non-existent) [O II] $\lambda$3727 and H$\alpha$ emission. This selection suggests that a recent burst of star formation was triggered but subsequently abruptly ended. The analysis uses H-delta equivalent widths. A stars cover 33 percent of the galaxy image.
