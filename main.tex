\section{April 2019}
\subsection{Week 16}

\par \citet{2018MNRAS.480.2217S} : {SDSS-IV MaNGA: characterizing non-axisymmetric motions in galaxy velocity fields using the Radon transform} :  We demonstrate the Radon transform by applying it to gas and stellar velocity fields from the first $\sim$2800 galaxies of the SDSS-IV MaNGA IFU survey. We separately classify gas and stellar velocity fields into five categories based on the shape of their radial PA$\kappa$ profiles. 
\par \citet{2003MNRAS.344.1000B} : {Stellar population synthesis at the resolution of 2003} : We present a new model for computing the spectral evolution of stellar populations... The model reproduces in detail typical galaxy spectra from the Early Data Release (EDR) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). This model should be particularly useful for interpreting the spectra gathered by modern spectroscopic surveys in terms of constraints on the star formation histories and metallicities of galaxies.


\par \citet{2000ApJ...529..886C} : {The Asymmetry of Galaxies: Physical Morphology for Nearby and High-Redshift Galaxies} : Describes how measured asymmetry can be an indicator of galaxy interaction or mergers.

\subsection{Week 15}
\par \citet{2012MNRAS.420..672S} : {From star-forming spirals to passive spheroids: integral field spectroscopy of E+A galaxies} : Abstract: We present three-dimensional spectroscopy of 11 E+A galaxies at z= 0.06-0.12. These galaxies were selected for their strong H$\delta$ [JP: 4102\AA] absorption but weak (or non-existent) [O II] $\lambda$3727 and H$\alpha$ emission. This selection suggests that a recent burst of star formation was triggered but subsequently abruptly ended. The analysis uses H-delta equivalent widths. A stars cover 33 percent of the galaxy image. 

\par \citet{1997A&A...325.1025P} : {Indicators of star formation: 4000 {\r{A}} break and Balmer lines.} : Dn4000 and equivalent width of Balmer lines. Describes the application of D$_n$4000 and H$\delta$ spectral indices as an indication of recent star formation. 
\par \citet{2004ApJ...609..683T} : {Field E+A Galaxies at Intermediate Redshifts ($0.3 < z < 1$)} : PSB galaxies.
\par \citet{2009MNRAS.395..144W} : {Post-starburst galaxies: more than just an interesting curiosity} : {Post-starburst galaxies in the VVDS : PCA of the $4000\AA$ break.} : Are gas-rich mergers an important mechanism for the build-up of the red sequence since $z\sim1$.
\par \citet{2004ApJ...608..752B} : {Nearly 5000 Distant Early-Type Galaxies in COMBO-17: A Red Sequence and Its Evolution since $z\sim1$} : Galaxy colour bi-modality
\par \citet{1972ApJ...176....1G} : {On the Infall of Matter Into Clusters of Galaxies and Some Effects on Their Evolution} : Ram pressure stripping.
\par \citet{2006MNRAS.366..787K} : {Kinemetry: a generalization of photometry to the higher moments of the line-of-sight velocity distribution}
\subsection{Week 14}
\par \citet{2011ApJ...742...11S} The Interstellar Medium in Distant Star-forming Galaxies: Turbulent Pressure, Fragmentation, and Cloud Scaling Relations in a Dense Gas Disk at z = 2.3.
